#Project Proposal

For my class project, I would like to create a script to analyze 
pedigree data on a population of kangaroo rats in Arizona. 
Banner-tailed kangaroo rat demography and dispersal have 
been monitored since 1979 on a 64-ha study site in the 
Chihuahuan desert. I plan to use R to create a 
16-generation pedigree, so that I can understand the 
fitness consequences of dispersal behavior among the 4 
metapopulations studied. I plan to use this project, with additional
analyses, as a chapter in my dissertation.
