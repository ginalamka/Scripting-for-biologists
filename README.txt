For my project, I am planning on creating a script to analyze pedigree data on a population of kangaroo rats in Arizona. Banner-tailed kangaroo rat demography and dispersal have been monitored since 1979 on a 64-ha study site in the Chihuahuan desert. I plan to use R to create a 16-generation pedigree, so that I can understand the fitness consequences of dispersal behavior among the 4 metapopulations studied. These data will be included as a chapter in my dissertation.
